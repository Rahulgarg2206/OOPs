### Procedural and OOP Paradigm

Procedural programming focuses on procedures or functions that operate on data, while OOP revolves around creating objects that encapsulate both data and functions. Key advantages of OOP include better code organization, reusability, and maintainability. Simula was the first OOP language, and SmallTalk was the first truly object-oriented language. Java is not purely object-oriented due to features like primitive data types and static variables.

### Key Differences Between Java and C++ in OOP

| Feature                    | Java                                           | C++                                                  |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Paradigm                   | Predominantly OOP (with primitives)            | Multi-paradigm (supports procedural and OOP)         |
| Memory Management          | Automatic (Garbage Collector)                  | Manual (uses new and delete)                         |
| Multiple Inheritance       | Not supported (achieved via interfaces)        | Natively supported                                   |
| Pointers                   | Not available (references only)                | Fully supported                                      |
| Destructors                | No destructors (handled by GC)                 | Explicit destructors required                        |
| Operator Overloading       | Not supported                                  | Fully supported                                      |
| Method Overriding          | Uses @Override annotation                      | Uses virtual keyword                                 |
| Access Specifiers          | public, private, protected                     | public, private, protected + friend keyword          |
| Exception Handling         | Mandatory (try-catch-finally)                  | Optional                                             |
| Templates vs Generics      | Uses Generics                                  | Uses Templates                                       |

### Topics to Focus On

#### Four Pillars of OOP

1. **Encapsulation**: Data hiding using private variables and public methods.
2. **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details using abstract classes and interfaces.
3. **Inheritance**: Creating class hierarchies to reuse code.
4. **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.

#### OOP Principles

- **Constructors & Destructors**: Manage object lifecycle.
- **Method Overloading vs Overriding**: Compile-time vs runtime polymorphism.
- **Virtual Functions**: Enable dynamic method binding in C++.
- **Abstract Classes vs Interfaces**: Understand when to use each.

#### Memory Management in OOP

- **Heap vs Stack**: Different memory allocation strategies.
- **Shallow vs Deep Copy**: Copying object references vs actual data.
- **Smart Pointers (C++)**: Automatic memory management.
- **Garbage Collection (Java)**: Automatic memory reclamation.

### Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for objects, defining their properties and methods. Objects are instances of classes. In C++, classes end with a semicolon, while in Java, they do not. Objects are stored in the heap memory area.

#### Static vs Dynamic Memory Allocation

| Feature        | Static Memory Allocation    | Dynamic Memory Allocation          |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Timing         | Compile time                | Runtime                            |
| Location       | Stack                       | Heap                               |
| Size           | Fixed                       | Variable                           |
| Management     | Automatic                   | Manual/Garbage Collected           |
| Speed          | Faster                      | Slower                             |
| Use Cases      | Local variables             | Objects, dynamic arrays            |

#### Access Specifiers

| Access Modifier | Within Class | Within Package | Outside Package by Subclass Only | Outside Package |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Private**     | Y            | N              | N                                | N               |
| **Default**     | Y            | Y              | N                                | N               |
| **Protected**   | Y            | Y              | Y                                | N               |
| **Public**      | Y            | Y              | Y                                | Y               |

#### Member Functions

In C++, member functions are part of a class and can access its data members. In Java, these are called methods. Types of member functions in C++ include simple, static, const, inline, and friend functions.

#### Structure and Class

In C++, structures have public members by default, while classes have private members by default. Both can be used for data grouping, but classes are preferred for OOP.

#### Templates and Generics

Templates in C++ and Generics in Java allow writing type-agnostic code. Templates use compile-time substitution, while Generics use type erasure.

---

### Constructor and Destructor

Constructors initialize object data members, while destructors clean up resources. C++ requires explicit destructors, while Java relies on garbage collection.

#### Garbage Collector in Java

The JVM automatically manages memory, reclaiming memory from objects no longer in use. Garbage collection can be triggered manually with `System.gc()`, though it's not guaranteed to run immediately.

#### JDK, JRE, and JVM in Java

- **JDK**: Java Development Kit for development.
- **JRE**: Java Runtime Environment to run applications.
- **JVM**: Java Virtual Machine that executes bytecode.

#### Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

- **Shallow Copy**: Copies object references; changes reflect across copies.
- **Deep Copy**: Creates independent object copies; changes are isolated.

### Important Keywords

| Keyword | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| static  | Belongs to class, not instance. |
| virtual | Enables polymorphism in C++. |
| abstract| Declares abstract class or method. |
| final   | Prevents modification or inheritance. |
| explicit| Disallows implicit type conversion. |
| this    | Refers to current object. |
| new     | Allocates memory for objects. |
| const   | Defines constant values. |
| super   | Refers to parent class. |

---

### Features of OOPs

#### Inheritance

Allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes. Java uses `extends`, while C++ uses `: public`.

#### Encapsulation

Bundles data and methods within a class, controlling access via access specifiers.

#### Abstraction

Hides complex implementation details, exposing only necessary functionality.

#### Interface in Java

Defines method signatures without implementation; supports multiple inheritance.

#### Polymorphism

Allows methods to perform different actions based on object type.

### OOPs Pillars Comparison Table

| Pillar        | Definition                                                   | Key Concept                  | Java Example                                             | Real-Life Example (Remote Control)                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Wrapping data & methods into a class; restricting direct access. | Data hiding                  | `private int volume; public int getVolume()`              | Volume is adjusted via buttons, hidden internally.                                                 |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding internal complexity, showing only relevant details.      | Hides how, shows what        | `abstract class Remote { abstract void powerOn(); }`     | Pressing "Power" without knowing internal workings.                                                |
| **Inheritance**   | One class acquires properties/methods of another.              | Code reuse                   | `class TVRemote extends Remote`                           | TV and AC remotes share common features from a base Remote class.                                  |
| **Polymorphism**  | Same method behaves differently based on context.              | Same name, many forms        | `Remote r = new TVRemote(); r.powerOn();`                 | `powerOn()` starts TV or AC depending on the remote type.                                          |
